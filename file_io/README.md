# File I/O

Implementations for basic file handling tasks in C:

- `read_textfile` reads a text file and prints up to a specified number of bytes to standard output.
- `create_file` creates or truncates a file with `rw-------` permissions.
- `append_text_to_file` appends text to an existing file.
- `cp` copies the contents of one file to another using a 1024-byte buffer.

Headers are in `main.h`. Functions follow Betty-style formatting.
